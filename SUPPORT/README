HOW TO PRECOMPUTE SIGMA

## NOTE THIS IS REALLY ONLY FOR INTERNAL USE !! DATABASE DEPENDENCIES ARE AVAILABLE ON REQUEST

1. ./R/generate_hapmap_recomb_regions.R - This creates for the genome a set of genomic regions that correspond to recomb blocks based on hapmap. Note database etc needs filling in.
2. configure and run ./perl/cal_sigma_1kg.pl ## note requires queue or access to compute farm
3. ./R/create_hapmap_index.R creates an index that is compatible with sandman

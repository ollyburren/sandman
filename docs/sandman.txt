SETUP

#1

Create a .sandman.cnf file that should be available in the dir containing your installation. See template in ./cnf directory

[SM]
## command to use to submit 
qsub=qsub -q <QNAME> -v R_LIBS=<RLIBS_DIR>
## location of Rscript
rscript=/usr/bin/Rscript
## whether to use SGE (untested without).
use_q=1
## If set to 1 tmp files are retained (useful for debug).
## set to 0 if you are tidy or bothered about disk space.
keep_tmp_files=1
## dir to use for grid scratch space (note must be available
## to queue hosts if use_q=1)

## How often to poll queue to see if dependent jobs finished
q_poll_time=5
## tabix location
tabix_bin=tabix
## location of tabix compatible snp catalogue file

## max regions to search at a time
tabix_chunksize=100
## ensmart default host
default_mart_host=www.ensembl.org
## Number of perms to process in a chunk
default_perm_per_chunk=1000

#2 configure an experiment.cnf see template in ./cnf directory

## override value in .sandman.cnf
mart_host=www.ensembl.org
## OPTIONAL: if set then use precomputed sigma's to
## generate permutations.
sigma_index=
## if set to 1 then this means that all precomputed sigma's 
## are used to generate perms, not just those overlapping
## input snp list. Note that this better approximates LD
## at a cost of speed. Consider setting to 1/true if you get
## an interesting result having used default.
full_sigma=0

## Need at least one dataset
[DATASET ds1]
## OPTIONAL: location of genotypes in snpMatrix/snpStats format.
## (see below). If set then sigma is generated based on
## control genotype LD/gene. Be careful using this for 
## very dense snp maps and non gene based region analysis.
## It will rapidly fill your disk!

GENESET FILE - Use if you have a list of genes

Has format where there should be at least one test set
and one control set.

ENSEMBLID\s+SET

e.g.

ENSG00000134242 test
ENSG00000334237 control

REGIONSET FILE - Use if you have a list of genomic regions

Pseudo BED format

CHROMOSOME\tSTART\tEND\tSET\tREGION_NAME

e.g. 

chr5	102170285	102428220	test	sim1
chr5	102428221	102686157	control	sim2

NOTE that REGION_NAME is optional, if not specified then software assigns regions.
NOTE that as it stands duplicated regions with different types have not yet been tested

EXCLUDE FILE 

A file that allows us to exclude various locations in the
genome e.g. MHC. Just define using bed format.

e.g.

chr1 12456 4567 excluded_region

PVAL FILE 

Currently pval file format is just rs\s+p.val

e.g

rs123 0.004

ANALYSIS FILE FORMAT

This should correspond to the gene sets defined in GENESET FILE.
Add a prefix of SET. 

e.g.

mytest SET.test SET.control

#3 run ./sandman.pl myexperiment.cnf

NB: Analysis is carried out in a modular way. As such it's worth debugging an analysis on a small number of perms, and then rerunning with this cranked up. The software will prompt to see if you wish to keep previous files already generated.

Results will be output to base_dir/results.tab
